| | Feedback | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Introduction** | Clear and to the point | 10/10 |  |
| **Evaluation** | Covers all the bases, with some real measurements and good insights drawn from the testing | 40/40 |  |
| **Design Vision** | Overall vision makes sense, though still pretty practical; a _little_ bit of out-of-the-box aspiration might have been nice: VR? 3D? Natural language? | 35/40 | Dream a little bit more |
| **References** | Decent list, though why is Fortnite API treated differently from the other references? Best to be consistent. We did ask for traditional formal reference formatting too | 7/10 | Formal references would have been ideal; Fortnite API should have been a reference too |
| **Writing** | Straightforward, clear, no obvious technical issues | 0 |  |
| **Version Control** | 11 commits | 0 |  |
| **Punctuality** | on time | 0 |  |
|  |  | **92/100** | **Total** |
