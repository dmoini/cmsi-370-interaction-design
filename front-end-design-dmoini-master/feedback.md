| | Feedback | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Application Description** | Clear, straightforward, and complete description. | 12/12 |  |
| **Web Service(s) Used** | The service is identified, with links to specific routes that you intend to use. | 12/12 |  |
| **Top-Level Design/Layout** | Clear description, helpful mockup! | 16/16 |  |
| **Usage Scenario 1** | This scenario is very clearly stated, with another really helpful mockup. | 12/12 |  |
| **Usage Scenario 2** | Same level of quality with the second scenario; good job! | 12/12 |  |
| **Design Rationale** | Decent explanation; assorted concepts are used well and in a specific way. | 12/12 |  |
| **Usability Metric Forecast** | Forecast is reasonable and sensible. Ideally though it could have used additional specific terms from the course material (e.g., there is a term in the course materials for what you did with the design, in making it feel like an extension of Fortnite; there is also a term for the general approach you have taken in the user interface; etc.).<br><br>One clarification: searching for names that turn out to be unavailable isn’t actually an error in the interaction design sense; things really did happen as expected, and the lack of results is more about the content of the database rather than usability. | 10/12 | Missed opportunity to connect metric forecasts to additional specific terms from the class and the field; a little misunderstanding on what constitutes a usability “error” |
| **References** | Not a whole lot of references, but at least they are done properly, with citations in the text and live links where available.<br><br>Other references you could have used: Nielsen (for the metrics), Shneiderman (if you had done more mapping of your design choices to concepts from the text), and Norman (same reason, like if you had brought mental models into the discussion). | 11/12 | Given references are well done, but a few more could have been added |
| **Writing** | Overall writing is understandable and clear, with one typo noticed: “…three section: …” | -1 | Tiny typo |
| **Version Control** | 16 commits | 0 |  |
| **Punctuality** | on time | 0 |  |
|  |  | **96/100** | **Total** |
