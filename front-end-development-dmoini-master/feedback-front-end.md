| | Feedback | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Model Implementation** | Straightforward HTML, detailed mock objects, proper rendering of mock results | 20/20 |  |
| **View Implementation** | Decently styled, clean, functional layout; very evocative of Fortnite, as it should be | 25/25 |  |
| **Controller Implementation** | Overall correct MVC flow; tiny bit of consolidation is possible with `catch` handlers (uniform error displayer function which takes the container selector and the message) | 24/25 | Consolidation opportunity with `catch` handlers |
